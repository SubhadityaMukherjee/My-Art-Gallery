Essence eater 
An eldritch being born from the collision of two black holes. Its insides are a sort of jagged space that consumes all just like its parents. It doesn’t really have any particular form or color but us non eldritch beings see them as something akin to an all consuming shapeless being with octopus like tentacles. 
It shrinks dramatically after birth to around the size of a normal human. 
Those who study these things have always wondered why. Perhaps it has a limit to the amount of matter it can hold? Who knows.
